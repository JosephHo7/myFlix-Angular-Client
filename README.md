# MyFlixAngularClient
This project was created as a front end code to display a Netflix-like movie application. In this app, a user may create a new user profile or login with an existing 
profile. Users can then view a database of movies, get more information about each movies genres, directors, and movie summaries. Users also have the ability to 
add or remove movies from a favorites list, which is unique to each user. Users can also update user information as well as delete a user profile. 

This application is connected to movies_API, which the respository can be found here: https://github.com/JosephHo7/movie_api
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.2.5.
